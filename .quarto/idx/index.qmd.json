Moreover, influenced by my father, I am fortunate enough to have access to technology soon after I could read, and since then, I have never doubted that I would devote my time to STEM.\n\nIntrigued by Statistics' unique role in simplifying complex information to deliver effective solutions to solve real-life problems while I took the AP courses, I decided to major in Applied Mathematics & Statistics. Thanks to my close connections with supporting professors in the tight community of Macalester College, I have built a solid academic foundation and explored different industries by completing multiple projects during my undergraduate study.\n\nBenefiting from the liberal arts education, I also realized the value of self-reflection and learned to examine issues from various angles, which helped me to form an introspective mindset to better find my roles in communities and creatively connect knowledge with its applications. Also, with the invaluable work experience I accumulated through internships, I now know that I want to start my career path as a professional in the field of operations research and analytics.\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.335","editor":"visual","theme":"darkly","title":"","about":{"id":"intro-heading","template":"trestles","image-width":"20em","image-shape":"round","image":"images/yiyang.jpg","links":[{"icon":"linkedin","href":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/易扬-时-7179161a2/"},{"icon":"github","href":"https://github.com/yiyangshi-hub"}]}},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
